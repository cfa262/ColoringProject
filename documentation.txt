Definitions

	Graph - a list of vertices and thier edges.
	        get by calling (states) or (graph-1)

	Cutset - a list of the cutset of the form
	         (fl va ca or ak)

	Colored Cutset list - a list of the cutset and
	                      the colors that it has been
	                      colored. Looks like:
	                      ((fl r) (ga y) ....)

	Colors - colors that we will use, call (colors)
	         to get the list (r g b y)        

	Remaining/Trees - the remaining vertices and their
	                  edges after the cutset was removed

	{v, e, c} - a list of the form (va (ma dc wv tn nc) (r b))
	            that has the vertex, its edges, and the
	            possible colors it can be colored           

How to run big functions/what do they do

	get-cutset(lst)
		-takes a graph as lst
		-returns its cutset

	get-high-deg(lst)
		-takes a graph
		-returns the first element with the highest
		 degree (most edges) in the graph

	get-remaining(lst graph)
		-takes a cutset as lst and a graph
		-return the remaining trees

	get-edges
		-takes a cutset as lst and a graph
		-returns a list of the cutset and its edges

	get-possible-colors(lst graph)
		-takes a colored cutset list as list and a graph
		-returns a remaining graph with the possible colors
		 each vertex can be after removing the colors from the
		 bordering elements in the colored cutset list. Essentially
		 returns a proper {v, e, c}

NOTE: If you need a specific function, ask if it is already written first,
      Most of the functions above have a lot of helpers that can be
      relevant to other functions
